# undergrad_research
For my undergrad students

HELLO, WELCOME TO MY FIRST ATTEMPT AT TEACHING PEOPLE - I'M SURE WE'LL ALL HAVE A GOOD TIME. 

First things first, the necessaries of what you need to do this research:

--> access to a linux workspace - I believe in Ubuntu supremacy, so that's preferred. You can find it here: https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop
    i) Jammy Jellyfish is preferred, as it is the most stable of the newer releases I believe. 
    ii) if you're having issues getting Ubuntu up and running, or simply don't want to not have Windows on your personal PC, there is a spare computer in my
        lab that you can use.
        
--> once you have Ubuntu, please download several packages to the computer. You can do this via sudo apt install (make sure you are the root user on your PC)
     perl: sudo apt install perl
     
     build-essential: sudo apt install build-essential
     
     gcc: sudo apt-get install manpages-dev
     
     libsdl2-dev: sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev
     
     gzip: sudo apt -y install gzip
     
     coreutils: sudo apt -y install coreutils
     
     bedtools: https://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/installation.html
     
     VCFtools: https://vcftools.github.io/examples.html
     
  To verify that these are all installed do: [package] --version
  if they are installed correctly, your PC should spit out the package name plus a version number. 
     
--> then download the .bed files for your specific Neanderthal from http://ftp.eva.mpg.de/neandertal/
    Maya: Chagyrskaya 8 (http://ftp.eva.mpg.de/neandertal/Chagyrskaya/FilterBed/)
    Megan: Vindija 33.19 (http://ftp.eva.mpg.de/neandertal/Vindija/FilterBed/Vindija33.19/)
    Jonathan: Altai (http://ftp.eva.mpg.de/neandertal/Vindija/FilterBed/Altai/)
      
      make sure these are accessible to your ubuntu workspace. 
    download all the chr .bed files, as it'll probably save time later. 
    
--> if you don't already, make sure you have a github account. it's super useful (and free!) it'll also allow you to copy (fork) my respositories easily.
    
--> the first three genes we'll be looking at are: GMBE1, TRAIP, RPN1.
    This is as I've found that these are DIFFERENT from the human versions of the genes in the Chagyrskaya Neanderthal, so I want to replicate research and then see if other Neas show the same differentiation.
    Look them up on https://www.genecards.org/ for a rough idea of what they do. What do they all have in common, for instance?
    
--> look at the file undergrad_work in this repository and have a go!
