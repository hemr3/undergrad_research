  #can also use whatever chr your heart (or research) desires

  #changing the 'chr3' to '3' to match other bedfiles. technically it is either or but can create confusion with 'chr'
  #h/ever this creates a file that is space delimited and bedfiles technically need to be TAB DELIMITED
  
awk -v OFS='\t' '{$1=$1}1' ~/3_cut_gencodes_exons.bed > ~/tab_3_cut_gencodes_exons.bed
  #this changes the space delimited file to a tab delimited one
  
bedtools sort -i ~/tab_3_cut_gencodes_exons.bed > ~/sorted_tab_3_cut_gencodes_exons.bed
  #make sure that all bedfiles are sorted before you begin messing with them. if not will definitely create issues down the line
  #also make sure that all are decompressed! otherwise issues ensue
  
 
 #### the next step is to download the .bed file from your specific specimen from: http://ftp.eva.mpg.de/neandertal/
 #### this will take a while
 
bedmap --echo --echo-map-id-uniq ~/chr3_mask.bed ~/sapiens_files/sorted_tab_3_cut_gencodes_exons.bed > ~/collated.bed 
	#using all of this, you can intersect two bedfiles to see where the same genes are - which is 	what the above demonstrates with the chag CHR3 files and this complete human one
	#bedops toolkit
	

####creating working .bed files with the gene names for the neanderthal CHR

#bed files created in the above steps have a | delimiter rather than a tab delimiter. 
#this kinda was fixed earlier but needs to be fixed again, as bedops does something funky.
#| delimited files are less well used - most programs use tab delimiters. you can adapt the code to deal with | delimiters, but if it ain't broke, don't fix it. 

sed 's/|/\t/g' ~/gene_names_chag3.txt > ~/only_names_chag3.txt

#then remove the stop position
awk '{print $2}' ~/only_names_chag3.txt > ~/only_names_chag3.txt

#remove duplicates of genes that appear
awk '!x[$0]++' ~/only_names_chag3.txt > only_names_chag3.txt

#remove lines that have more than one gene name on them (without removing Ensembl gene lines)
awk 'length<19' ~/only_names_chag3.txt > ~/try2_only_names.txt

#remove the semicolon and the quote marks:
cat ~/try2_only_names.txt | tr -d '"' | tr -d ';' > only_names.txt

#take only Ensembl gene lines to convert:
cat ~/only_names_chag3.txt | grep '^EN' > ~/ensembl_chag3.txt
	#THE ABOVE STEP IS NOT ENTIRELY NECESSARY, DO AT YOUR OWN DISGRESSION


#for specific genes - you first need to create a bed file with the format chrom number  start stop for that particular gene
#this can be found by looking on the .bed files made and essentially just copying/grepping them into a new file. honestly, I just did ctrl+f and copied to a new document. much easier. 
#once done, use the VCFs and this new .bed file to create a new VCF with only these gene positions in:
vcftools --gzvcf ~/Documents/chag_vcfs/chr3.noRB.vcf.gz --bed ~/Documents/traip.bed --out ~/Documents/traip_chr3_chag --recode --keep-INFO-all

####for protein seq and visualisation....
#we will discuss this before you do it!!

awk '{print $1,$2,$3,$4,$5}' ~specific_gene_vcfs/foxp1_chr3_chag.vcf > ~/specific_gene_vcfs/foxp1_first5.txt
#this removes all but necessary columns from file needed for SeqTailor. have to manually delete the top bit though
